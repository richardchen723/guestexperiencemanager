# Cost Notes (Free Tier):
# - RDS db.t4g.micro: FREE for 12 months, then ~$15/month (single-AZ, ARM-based)
# - RDS Storage (20GB): FREE for 20GB in first 12 months, then ~$2/month
# - RDS Backups: FREE for 20GB in first 12 months, then ~$0.50/month (1 day retention)
# - S3: 5GB free for 12 months, then varies by usage
# - Total estimated: FREE for first 12 months, then ~$17-20/month
#
# Cost Notes (After Upgrading Account - Recommended for Production):
# - RDS db.t4g.medium: ~$50/month (4GB RAM, 2 vCPU, better performance)
# - RDS Storage (20GB): ~$2/month
# - RDS Backups: ~$1/month (7 days retention)
# - S3: Varies by usage, lifecycle policies reduce costs significantly
# - Total estimated: ~$53-60/month for small internal application with good performance
